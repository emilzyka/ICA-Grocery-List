# ICA-Grocery-List
Automates and randomize the process of making a grocery shopping list on ICA webiste
This program finds and adds random recipes to your shopping list on the ICA app. All recipes are taken from "middagar".
As such don't you can't use it for baking- or dessert recipes. All recipes added to your shopping list will be unique. 
You can select sorting category, number of recipes you want to add, and how many recipes to pick a random from.
There is no exception handling in the program. Make sure all inputs are made with the correct datatype. 
Sometimes pages or elements loads too quick/slow, and the program will crash because of that.
